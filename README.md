# C++ SFML GUI Elements
Premade, easy to use GUI buttons and switches.

Include buttons.h by adding this line to your code:
#include "buttons.h"
And make sure to add the header file to the "Header Files" folder inside your project.

There's information on how to use the elements at the top of the header file as well as a main.cpp template to really show you how to properly use these elements.

For any questions, feel free to email me at snglol@live.se with the topic set as "C++ SFML GUI Elements - (your name)".
I will be adding more elements with time and anything else I might have use for myself.
